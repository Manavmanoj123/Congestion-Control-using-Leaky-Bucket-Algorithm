# Congestion-Control-using-Leaky-Bucket-Algorithm
This program simulates the Leaky Bucket algorithm, used for controlling data flow in networks. It processes incoming packets, stores them in a buffer (bucket), and transmits them at a fixed rate. If the buffer overflows, excess packets are dropped, mimicking real-world congestion control.
